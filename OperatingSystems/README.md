These are projects I created for my operating systems course. 

We had to either write a paper discussing something in the operating system
	such as system calls, paging simulators, and system interrupts or we
	could have written programs and discussed the effects they have on the
	operating system.

I decided to create a few programs enclosed in this folder.
Some of these SHOULD NOT be run. I have removed a good portion of the code
	as a safety precaution. I have also left out a class to prevent one
	of the projects from working. 

The folder marked GUIProjects is SAFE. There is nothing in there that is dangerous.
	Open that README for more information about what that folder contains.


PLEASE TAKE GREAT PRECAUTIONS WHEN REVIEWING THIS FOLDERâ€™S CONTENTS.

ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMS WILL FLAG SOME OF THESE FILES IF YOU ATTEMPT TO RUN, BUT
	I HIGHLY ADVISE AGAINST RUNNING.
