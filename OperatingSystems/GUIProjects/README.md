GUIProjects

This project contains a group assignments assigned in my
	operating systems course. 

All of the programs are written in Java. 

FileCopy:
	Takes in a file path determined by the user copies it and renames
		it whatever the user chooses. If the newFile already exists
		an error is displayed and the user must accept to overwrite.

NameClient, NameServer, and WorkerClass:
	Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get this project working correctly.
	I was able to get the Server and Client working properly. The 
		worker class I had a problem with because I couldn’t get 
		the website names to resolve. The programs to take in a
		website’s name and return the IP address of the site.

PagingSim:
	This program simulates the paging operating systems use to store and
		retrieve data. 

In order to run this program open cmd/terminal

$ cd ../GUIProjects

$javac MainClass.java

$java MainClass

After doing those steps a GUI opens and allows you to choose desired program.
