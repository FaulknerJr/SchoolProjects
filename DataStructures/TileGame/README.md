I created this program in Spring 2014.

The program is designed to solve tile games.

The user has to input the start state and the solution in numbers.

After that is done the program does a depth first search moving the “empty” tile
	up down left or right until the puzzle is solved.

To run this project

cd ../TileGame

javac Main.java

java Main


After doing that follow the prompts in the program.

I created this a while ago so all the error checking is not complete.
